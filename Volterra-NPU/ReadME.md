## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository is to provide the code in Python, C++ and Java(Android), for windows and android, to get the leverage of NPU, CPU and GPU of Microsoft Dev Kit 2023 (Project Volterra).

The application included in this repository are:
- Object Detection - [Python](src/windows/python/ObjectDetection/) [C++](src/windows/cpp/ObjectDetection/)
- Image Classification - [Python](src/windows/python/Classification/) [C++](src/windows/cpp/Classification/) [Android](src/android/ImageClassification/)
- Super Resolution - [Python](src/windows/python/SuperResolution/) [C++](src/windows/cpp/SuperResolution/) [Android](src/android/SuperResolution/)
- Semantic Segmentation - [Python](src/windows/python/SemanticSegmentation/) 
- Speech Recognition - [Python](src/windows/python/Whisper/) [Android](src/android/SpeechRecognition/)

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
